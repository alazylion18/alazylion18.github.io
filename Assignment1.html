<!-- Fun Fact: My instagram account is set to private but my photos are still accessible with an internet link. 
                So theoretically, I could access any photo on instagram with a url generator. I've already written
                a regex function to replace the pattern at the end of the url. I need to write the script which will generate
                "realistic" urls, so that the script can check if the url loads a photo. If a photo is loaded, save the 
                url as a true url. After a while, a machine learning algorithm could suggest much better urls than an
                incrementing url generator. I WOULD LOVE HELP ON THE PROJECT, BUT PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE ELSE!! 
                I WOULD LOVE TO SHOW INSaTAGRAM BEFORE THE WORLD KNOWS... HOPEFULLY FIXING THE BUG BEFORE A HACKER CREATES A 
                SCRIPT SIMILAR TO MINE. -->
